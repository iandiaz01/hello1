                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Ian Diaz and I am a student at KSU pursuing a degree in IT. I live in Duluth, GA and was born and raised there. My parents are from Mexico, both born and raised in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and came to the United States at a young age. Although I was not born in Mexico, I take pride in my Mexican heritage! I love playing video games, especially the Fallout series, and enjoy spending time in nature and connecting with it.</p>
                <p>I am 22 years old and have had many experiences, both good and bad. As I get older, I see the world from different perspectives. My views on people and the world have changed significantly from my high school days. I have gone through typical human struggles, hardships, good times, and bad times. All these experiences have helped me become who I am today and have shaped my responses to the world and the people around me.</p>
                <p>I plan to graduate soon and earn my IT degree to make myself and my parents proud. I aim to find a well-paying job that allows me to move forward in life while also pursuing the things I love. My parents did not have the opportunity to attend college, and I want to give back for all the support they have given me.</p>
